Just a repo for testing GitHub Pages.

Also using this as a playground for experimentation, specifically for adding
[documentation with reader-defined variables](https://codepen.io/msquared-au/pen/RwvPWBm)
to a GitHub Pages site (see page 2 of the generated site).

Originally, the idea was to add a custom Jekyll tag or two, but this is not
supported by GitHub Pages, because it uses a restricted list of plugins
that can't be overridden.

Some experimentation yielded positive results by using include directives
with parameters, but this doesn't work inside of code blocks.  Supporting this
might require manually using pre and/or code HTML tags in place of markdown
code blocks.

(As a separate thing, though it might not solve the above problem, it appears
to be fairly simple to control the Jekyll build process and allow custom
plugins by using a custom GitHub Action to perform the Jekyll build for
GitHub Pages; see
[Jekyll's documentation on GitHub Actions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/).)
